=== Description ===                                               {{{1

  fnjs - functional javascript

  fnjs ("fungus"? -- let's hope it spreads ...) is more or less a
  clojure DSL that produces javascript.  It's not a platform like
  clojurescript, but simply a nicer way to write javascript -- with
  clojure syntax.

  See examples/overview.fnjs for an annotated example of the current
  implementation.
                                                                  }}}1

=== Roadmap ===                                                   {{{1

  v0.[1-8].X will probably see many changes.  I'll try to keep the
  apis stable, but no promises.  Things may change; and break existing
  code.  Starting with v0.9.0, point releases should always be
  backward-compatible; and hopefully things will have stabilised to
  the extent that no major backward-incompatible changes will occur at
  all, only incremental improvements.
